    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Frequency and vocabulary lists are in the form of:<br>
    [word]  [definition OR frequency]<br>
    [word]  [definition OR frequency]<br>
    ...<br></p>
    <p>When given a frequency list, Vocab Finder returns all the words of the text
    that did not occur in the list, as well as the lowest-frequency words that occurred,
    for a total of 100 words.
